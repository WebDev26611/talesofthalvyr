        Shattered by war, what is left of Lark’s life fractures when betrayal hits him where he trusted most. 
        He will traverse Thalvyr, seeking revenge— maybe not all leaders are meant to be good…

      <p class="dropdown fade-in">Ilk</p>
      <ul class="dropdown-display fade-in">
        <li>Durds: an Ilk of tree-men, as old as time. They created the language of Ekrion, spoken by their kind, as well as the Dars and the Vorkan. When Thalvyr was born, souls of some Saytar fell to it, preferring to observe rather than fight. Those souls took embodiment, and gained mortality, taking the forms of trees, growing in their roots.</li>
        <li>Chillers: an Ilk born from the Underland, a place of pure evil. From the language of Ekrion, they created Derki and spread it to the rest of the Ilk. In an effort to eradicate the Saytar, a few of the Aytar souls also fell to Thalvyr, gaining form as Chillers.</li>
        <li>Wizards: an Ilk who can control magic to its utmost extent.</li>
        <li>Men: an Ilk whose only abilities are courage, violence and pride, sometimes adding intellect to the mix.</li>
        <li>Cyborgs: an Ilk created to enhance the Men, but rebelled, now their own kind.</li>
        <li>Dars: an Ilk built of Ice, who died out in the Land, remaining in the Land beyond the Sea. Originally Durds found the Ice and gave each
          equal amounts, keeping the rest. Their most powerful are known as Keepers.</li>
        <li>Vorkan: an Ilk made of flame, the counterparts of the Dars. They never existed in the Land, and fought valiantly
          against the Dars in the Land beyond the Sea.  Originally Durds who found the Flame and decided upon a
          leader, their King, to claim the most of it, and the rest got a small amount.</li>
        <li>Eldorin: the original inhabitants of Thalvyr, not created by either the Aytar or the Saytar, who, upon the
          creation of the rest, hid in the Sea for fear of war. They are an Ilk born from the Sea itself. The Eldorin are a part of the Sea and the Sea is a part of them.</li>
        <li>The Saytar: creatures of light, dwelling in the Sky. They have used the two primordial forces of the Flame and the Ice. They created most of the Ilk, some of their souls residing in the Durds.</li>
        <li>The Aytar: creatures of darkness, dwelling in the Underland. They have mastery over the most powerful primordial force: the Void. They could create no other Ilk than the Chillers, their efforts for more futile. So they strengthened their creation.</li>

      <ul class="dropdown-display fade-in">
        <li>Lark: the main character, a Chiller who witnessed everything in his life go wrong.</li>
        <li>Rew: Lark's former best friend, now turned enemy. Will he be able to reforge the bond between them?</li>
        <li>Vey: Lark's most loyal subordinate. What is to come of her?</li>
        <li>Lardis: a most powerful Chiller, who was Lark's father, died fighting Durds Rew awoke. He was the leading warrior in the Great War. He bore a powerful axe, known as

      <p class="dropdown fade-in">Lands</p>
      <ul class="dropdown-display fade-in">
        <li>The Underland: a place of pure evil, inhabited by the Aytar, those who created the Chillers. The Aytar are
          neutral in wars, but not the affairs of Races.</li>
        <li>The Sky: a place of fairness, inhabited by the Saytar, who created the rest of the Ilks. The Saytar are neutral
          in everything, unlike the Aytar.</li>
        <li>The Land: a place of balance between the Sky and the Underland, the board where the Ilks fight as pawns in the
          war between the Aytar and Saytar. A land of eventual peace.</li>
        <li>The Land beyond the Sea: a place of war, where only the Dars and Vorkan fight for control.</li>
        <li>The Shadow Realm: a realm possessed only by Chillers and Aytar, where a soul is tormented from entrance until
          the Realm-holder dies, or releases them.</li>
        <li>The Void: a realm possessed only by the Aytar, where what goes in does not come out.</li>
        <li>The Sea: a realm where the Eldorin hide, and where the Eldorin's control is strongest.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="dropdown fade-in">Lore</p>
      <ul class="dropdown-display fade-in"><li>The Great War: a war over the Dars' gold, which was yet to be claimed after they died out. Ending in a truce,
          each Ilk recieved a fair share of it, not accounting for the lives lost. No wars can be started over what happened
          in it, no matter what happened.</li>
        <li>The Ice: one of the four primordial forces, taking shape in the Land beyond the Sea.</li>
        <li>The Flame: the second of the four primordial forces, also taking shape in the Land beyond the Sea, the opposite
          of the Ice.</li>
        <li>The Void: the third of the four primordial forces, transformed into a place, governed only by the Aytar.</li>
        <li>The Sea: the last of the primordial forces. It has taken shape and created the Eldorin, interconnecting them
          both.</li>
        <li>The Dars and Vorkan: when Durds first arrived at the Land beyond the Sea, they split into two groups, and one
          discovered the Flame, and the other, the Ice. It transformed them.
        <li>Aytar (the Silent One): Lardis. Lark's father became an Aytar after death. He quickly manipulated them and gained power over them, becoming their ruler.
        </li>
        <li>Wizards (the One): the heir to the Wizard throne. Their first developing power is mind reading. Others include teleportation and direct contact with the Saytar. The One is the most powerful Wizard.
